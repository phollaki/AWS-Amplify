To connect a React application with AWS AppSync and Amplify GraphQL, you can follow these steps:

1. **Set Up AWS Amplify Project**:

   Install the Amplify CLI globally if you haven't already:

   ```sh
   npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli
   ```

   Initialize a new Amplify project in your React app's root directory:

   ```sh
   amplify init
   ```

2. **Add API to Amplify Project**:

   Add a new API to your Amplify project:

   ```sh

   const listTodos = async () => {
     const response = await API.graphql({ query: queries.listTodos });
     const todos = response.data.listTodos.items;
     console.log(todos);
   };

   // Example GraphQL mutation
   const createTodo = async () => {
     const todo = { name: 'New Todo', description: 'Description' };
     await API.graphql({ query: mutations.createTodo, variables: { input: todo } });
   };
   ```

7. **Subscribe to Real-Time Updates**:

   You can also subscribe to real-time updates using the `API` object:

   ```jsx
   import { API, graphqlOperation } from 'aws-amplify';

   // Example subscription
   const subscription = API.graphql(
     graphqlOperation(subscriptions.onCreateTodo)
   ).subscribe({
     next: (eventData) => {
       const newTodo = eventData.value.data.onCreateTodo;
       console.log('New Todo:', newTodo);
     },
   });
   ```
